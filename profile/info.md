Hello! Iâ€™m Ahmet, the founder of Nodeist. Allow me to provide you with a brief introduction about our team.
 
**Entity name and location**

Nodeist / Turkey


**Infrastructure location**

Our bare-metal infrastructure is located in Europe: Germany, Finland.
For our validator infrastructure, we primarily utilize bare-metal servers provided by Hetzner & OVHcloud. These servers are located in Europe, ensuring optimal performance and reliability for our operations.

 
**Technical make-up of team**

We are an intriguing team of 3 DevOps engineers, passionately dedicated to problem management and the creation of self-healing, highly available systems. With more than 5 years of professional experience working as SRE/DevOps engineers at a prominent cloud service provider, we have cultivated our skills in ensuring system reliability. Since 2021, we have been actively involved in validating Cosmos chains, immersing ourselves in the fascinating world of blockchain technology.
 

**Years of experience**

With over 5 years of captivating experience in the field of DevOps engineering, we have mastered the art of building robust and efficient systems. Additionally, we possess more than 3 years of expertise in running nodes for diverse crypto projects, allowing us to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape.
 

**What other networks are you running validators for?**

Currently, we are actively validating 6 Cosmos networks, and we proudly serve as genesis validators for 6 of them;
 
Jackal Protocol (Genesis)
Realio Network (Genesis)
Sge Network (Genesis)
Govgen (Genesis)
Atomone (Genesis)
Source Protocol (Genesis)
 
In addition, we also operate nodes for Cosmos and Osmosis networks where we provide IBC Relayer services, although we are not actively participating as validators in those networks. Our involvement in running nodes for these networks enables us to facilitate secure and efficient cross-chain communication through the IBC protocol.
 

**Our Active Cosmos Ecosystem Testnets:**
 
We are currently actively participating in various testnets within the Cosmos ecosystem. These testnets serve as valuable environments for us to experiment, validate, and refine our infrastructure and configurations. By actively engaging in these testnets, we stay at the forefront of the evolving Cosmos ecosystem, ensuring that our systems are prepared for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
